1.  A C header file that contains typedef declarations for exact-width integer types. The bmp.h header file then typedef's these again
    to it's own naming conventions.
2.  The exact width types will be the same across all systems, whereas otherwise the size can vary from system to system.
3.  BYTE = 1 byte; DWORD = 4 bytes; LONG = 4 bytes; WORD = 2 bytes
4.  In hexadecimal: 42 4D
5.  biSize is the numbers of bytes of the structure; bfSize is the number of bytes of the bitmap file.
6.  It means the image is top down, and the origin is the upper left hand corner.
7.  biBitCount
8.  When using fopen to open a file, NULL would indicate that the file was not found. When using fopen to write, NULL would 
    indicate that there was an error creating the file.
9.  Because we're only reading one block, looking for a BITMAPINFOHEADER.
10. Zero
11. fseek lets you dictate the location of a file pointer; offset by a set amount, and indicate the direction of the offset.
12. The current location of a file pointer.
